# FPGA BlockDesign - PyView

A FPGA block overview using a Flask Banckend and an angular frontend.
Before Running the application please make sure your prereqs are fulfilled as described in the Setup section.

### Structure
Within the `backend` folder contains a python project, serving a [flask_restful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) api.
The `frontend` folder is a [angular](https://angular.io) app, that visualizes the contents of the api.

python setup.py install
```

For developers consider running. The `--user` flag has to be ommited when installing in (venv)
```shell
python setup.py develop --user

  sudo apt update
  # add PPA for latest LTS version
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
  sudo apt install nodejs
  ```
- Then add [angular cli](https://cli.angular.io/)
  ```shell
